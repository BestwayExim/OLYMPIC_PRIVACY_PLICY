    <h1>Privacy Policy for Olympic Compat App</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 31/05/2024</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Olympic Compat App. Your privacy is important to us. This
      Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information
      when you use our fitness-based application available within our fitness
      office.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Olympic Compat App is a fitness-based application designed for use within
      our gym. Our app serves two main functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gym-Based Users</strong>: Access to food items, telemedicine
        services, and a gym-related e-commerce store.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Facility Rental</strong>: Booking and contacting for renting our
        gym facilities during free times.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal data from users of the Olympic Compat App. This
      Privacy Policy outlines the details of our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We want to assure you that we do not collect, store, or process any
      personal data from users of the Olympic Compat App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use any personal
      information for any purposes, including but not limited to marketing,
      analysis, or third-party sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Olympic Compat App includes links and access to third-party services
      such as telemedicine providers and an e-commerce store. Please be aware
      that these third-party services operate independently and have their own
      privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
      third-party services you access through our app.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Facility Rental</h2>
    <p>
      Users who wish to rent our gym facilities can book and contact us through
      the app. We do not collect any personal data during this process. Any
      communication regarding facility rental will be handled outside the app,
      and users are responsible for providing any necessary contact information
      directly through email or other means.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Even though we do not collect personal data through the app, we take the
      security of our systems seriously. We implement appropriate technical and

      used for facility rental inquiries.
